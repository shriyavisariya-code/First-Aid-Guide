        <ul>
            <li><b>Step 1:</b>Immobilize the area. If possible, support the injured limb in the position it was found. Use a splint or sling if you know how, but don’t force it.</li>
            <li><b>Step 2:</b>Control any bleeding. Apply gentle, firm pressure to any bleeding wounds with a clean dressing or cloth.</li>
            <li><b>Step 3:</b>Apply ice. Use an ice pack wrapped in a cloth to help reduce swelling and pain. Do not apply ice directly to the skin.</li>
            <li><b>Step 4:</b>Seek medical help. Call for emergency medical services immediately. A fracture requires professional medical attention.</li>
